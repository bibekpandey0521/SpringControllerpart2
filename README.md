🚀 Spring Boot Learning - Day 8! 🎯

Today, I explored form handling in Spring Boot and learned how to:
✅ Send data from form input fields 📩
✅ Use @ModelAttribute to process and display user input 🏷️
✅ Create a User POJO class for managing data efficiently 👨‍💻

This was a great step in understanding how Spring MVC processes user input and binds form data to model attributes! Excited to build more interactive web applications! 🚀

Anyone else working with Spring Boot forms? Let’s connect and discuss! 🔥
